# Corny-Code-Quiz

This is a quick coding quiz to highlight a few things we've learned so far in the bootcamp. You can keep track of your score. 
One slight tweak to the acceptance criteria is that if you get 0, you cannot save your score but instead are prompted to try your skills again. 
As for the styling, I showed off a few skills we learned like using css variables and pseudo-classes to drive some visual behavior.
